        "Colab is making it easier than ever to integrate powerful Generative AI capabilities into your projects. We are launching public preview for a simple and intuitive Python library (google.colab.ai) to access state-of-the-art language models directly within Colab environments. All users have free access to most popular LLMs, while paid users have access to a wider selection of models. This means users can spend less time on configuration and set up and more time bringing their ideas to life. With just a few lines of code, you can now perform a variety of tasks:\n",

            "\n",
            "Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored her mood. She walked to the kitchen, seeking the familiar ritual of tea, when her gaze fell on a small, unassuming ceramic mug on the highest shelf – a mug she hadn't used in years. It was chipped, a faded floral pattern barely visible beneath a film of dust. It was her grandmother’s.\n",
            "\n",
            "With a stool, she retrieved it, the ceramic cool and light in her hands. As she ran a thumb over the worn rim, a scent bloomed in the air, sudden and sharp: cinnamon and ginger. Not from the mug itself, but *through* it. A memory, vibrant and whole, flooded her.\n",
            "\n",
            "She was seven, perched on a stool in her grandmother's sun-drenched kitchen. Her grandmother, smelling of flour and warmth, carefully spooning gingerbread batter into a tin, explaining how the spices \"woke up\" the flavour. Amelia had felt so safe, so loved.\n",
            "\n",
            "She blinked, the scent fading as quickly as it had arrived. Heart pounding, she held the mug again, focusing. This time, she pictured the old oak tree in her childhood backyard. A faint, earthy smell of damp bark and freshly cut grass filled the air, accompanied by the distant, joyful sound of children's laughter – her own, echoing from decades past.\n",
            "\n",
            "The mug was a conduit. Not just to memories, but to *sensory echoes* of them. A tear traced a path down her cheek, not of sadness, but of profound connection. She spent the rest of the evening, rain still falling, holding the mug, letting it guide her through forgotten moments. The feel of her first puppy’s soft fur, the specific, tinny clang of the bell on her first bicycle, the taste of her father's burnt pancakes on a camping trip.\n",
            "\n",
            "By the time the first streaks of dawn lightened the sky, Amelia felt lighter than she had in years. The house still sighed, but now, it felt like a gentle whisper of promise. The mug hadn't solved her problems, but it had reminded her that even in the dustiest corners of memory, there were still vibrant, living things waiting to be rediscovered, and that sometimes, the most ordinary objects held the most extraordinary magic."
